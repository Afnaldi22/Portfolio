            I'm a software engineer with 3-year experience. As a skilled Software Engineer employee, I would like to offer myself as a candidate for the job. It’s been almost 3 years since I’ve been working as Software Engineer, Front End Developer, and Full Stack Web Developer. In these 3 years, I have worked with many people and companies, making me a skilled and experienced Software Engineer worker. My typing speed has also proven satisfactory to all my old clients.
